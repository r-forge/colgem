Description: This package provides methods to compute the likelihood of a gene
    genealogy using coalescent models for populations with complex demographic
    histories.  A common example of a complex demographic history is the
    Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model of infectious disease dynamics and
    variations thereof.  These methods may be used to obtain MLEs of
    compartmental models.
